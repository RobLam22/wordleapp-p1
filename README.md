# Wordle - Project 1

## Introduction
This project was to create and attempt my own version of Wordle. Although as far as I could get, the only creativity I added were my own colours and bugs.

## How To Play
The page will load without any information because I assume everyone knows how to play Wordle. If not, they will navigate to the README. and learn how to play here.

Players will have a chance to guess a 5 letter word in 6 tries or less.

The letters will be coloured in 3 different colours listed below:
* Dark blue - Letters that are correct and in the correct position.
* Yellow - Letters that exist in the word, but are in the incorrect position.
* Grey - The letter does not exist in the word, it will be greyed out. However you can still enter the greyed out letters again to make another word.

If the word does not exist or if you try to check a word that is less than 5 letters, you will be prompted with an Error message that will appear under the Title.

## Features That Maybe Added
* A score counter - where the player can continue to keep playing and track their record with most correct words in a row
* Duordle - Having to guess two 5 letter words at the same time but with both words sharing a letter.
* Displaying an introduction popup message to appear
* A refresh button to clear the page and try again.

## Conclusion
Problem solving is fun! Extra fun with people who know how to code much better than me. Shoutout to IAs and Instructors who helped get me to where I am now with this project.

I have bad time management and obsessed too much on small problems before getting the core code to work. Thank you to Galit for being my real life rubber duck and helping me troubleshoot / debug my code so it can submitted with a passable standard.

I have learnt that I need to understand functions more as one core element of my code to resolve all my problems needed to be in a function and called earlier. 

Overall I felt a big sense of accomplishment being able to build a lot of the code from the ground up. It will be interesting to see if everyone else has similar code or had a unique approach to the project.

This project has given me confidence in my ability to code and has put me in a position where I feel ready to be doing this for a career.
